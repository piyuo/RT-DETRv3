# Model Inference Validation for Quantized RT-DETRv3
# ==================================================
#
# This script validates the final quantized ONNX model by running inference on
# test images and visualizing the results. It ensures that quantization hasn't
# degraded model performance and validates the complete pipeline.
#
# Validation Features:
# 1. Load and test the quantized production model
# 2. Run inference on demo images
# 3. Validate detection accuracy and quality
# 4. Compare results with original model (if available)
# 5. Generate visualization with bounding boxes and labels
# 6. Performance benchmarking and timing analysis
#
# Test Scenarios:
# - Object detection accuracy validation
# - Quantization impact assessment
# - Performance measurement (speed and memory)
# - Visual result verification
# - Production readiness confirmation
#
# Input:  onnx/output/rtdetrv3_r18vd_6x.onnx (Quantized production model)
# Output: Inference results with visualizations and performance metrics
#
# This is the final validation step before deploying the model to production.
