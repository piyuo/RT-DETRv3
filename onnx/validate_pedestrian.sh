# Pedestrian-Specific Re-ID Validation
# ===================================
#
# This script performs specialized validation for pedestrian Re-ID applications,
# focusing on person-to-person distinguishability and counting accuracy. It's
# particularly useful for crowd analysis, surveillance, and pedestrian tracking.
#
# Validation Features:
# 1. Person detection accuracy assessment
# 2. Pedestrian Re-ID embedding quality
# 3. Person-to-person distinguishability metrics
# 4. Duplicate detection and filtering
# 5. Pedestrian counting accuracy
# 6. Real-world scenario testing
#
# Use Cases:
# - Pedestrian counting systems
# - Crowd monitoring applications
# - Person tracking in surveillance
# - Re-identification across camera views
#
# Prerequisites:
# - Backbone model with exported features
# - Test images containing pedestrians
#
# Important: Uses the same feature map as pipeline validation (Concat.3 for C4)
