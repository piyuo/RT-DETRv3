# BoT-SORT Integration Test for RT-DETRv3 Re-ID Embeddings
# =======================================================
#
# This script demonstrates the integration of RT-DETRv3 Re-ID embeddings with
# BoT-SORT (Byte Track + Re-ID) multi-object tracking algorithm. It shows how
# the generated embeddings can be used for robust object tracking across frames.
#
# Integration Features:
# 1. Loading and processing Re-ID embeddings
# 2. Computing embedding similarity matrices
# 3. Simulating BoT-SORT matching algorithms
# 4. Demonstrating tracking association logic
# 5. Performance evaluation metrics
#
# Prerequisites:
# - Successful validation from validate_reid_pipeline.sh
# - Re-ID embeddings generated and validated
#
# The test demonstrates:
# - Embedding distance calculations (cosine similarity)
# - Matching algorithms for object association
# - Tracking consistency across detections
# - Performance metrics for tracking quality
#
# Note: This is a demonstration/test script. For production BoT-SORT integration,
# refer to the actual BoT-SORT repository and adapt the embedding interface.
